# :headphones:YouTunes
<p><i>Capstone project for my BS in Software Development.</i></p>

<p><b>YouTunes is a dynamic web application which allows users to:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Browse artists and albums</li>
  <li>Add or delete artists and albums</li>
  <li>Get artist recommendations based on their preferences via the Discover interface</li>
 </ul>
 
 ## Tech Stack
 JakartaEE
<p>:small_blue_diamond: Model: Java classes which manage a MySQL database</p>
<p>:small_blue_diamond: View: JSPs with CSS styling</p>
<p>:small_blue_diamond: Controller: Java servlet</p>

## Process
<p>I began by creating a technical design document including application features, user personas,
user stories and work estimations, and hand-drawn prototypes.</p>
<p>Development is being completed over the course of three one-week 'sprints'. During each sprint, functional tests are performed
and documented, and virtual Scrum checkins are done every two days to report on current progress and any roadblocks.</p>

<p><b>Sprint 1:</b> Database design and initialization; creation of core classes (Artist and Album); setup of basic JSPs</p>
<p><b>Sprint 2:</b> Creation of servlet class and database manager classes; completion of some functions including viewing, adding, and updating artists</p>
<p><b>Sprint 3:</b> Completion of JSPs, including functions to view, add, and update albums; finalizing CSS styling</p>
